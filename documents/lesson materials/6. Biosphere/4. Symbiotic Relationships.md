  <h3>Symbiotic Relationships</h3>
</div>

Relationships between the populations of two (or more) species can be positive, neutral, or negative. Populations can also change their relationships depending on the living circumstances.

|**Effect from the interactions between species “A” and “B”**|**Type of relationship**|**Relationship**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|**+ 0**|commensalism|<p>A relationship between or among living things where one benefits, and the other does not get impacted.</p><p></p><p>A has benefits from B’s existence, but B gets neither harmed nor helped.</p>|
|**+ +**|mutualism / cooperation|<p>A relationship between or among living things that benefit from each other’s existence.</p><p></p><p>A and B have mutual benefit from their existence. If there is a direct connection between them – mutualism. If such connection does not exist – cooperation.</p>|
|**0 0**|neutralism|<p>A relationship between two species that interact but do not affect each other.</p><p></p><p>A and B do not make any impact on each other.</p>|
|**- -**|competition|<p>A relationship between or among living things that compete for a limited resources, such as food, space, shelter, mate, ecological status, etc.</p><p></p><p>A and B have negative effects on each other.</p>|
|**+ -**|predation / parasitism|<p>A relationship where one of the species benefits from the other’s existence while it gets harmed.</p><p></p><p>A has negative impact on B, by hunting B (predation).</p><p>A lives on B and benefits itself from it, by feeding of of B and impacts B negatively (parasitism).</p>|
|**- 0**|amensalism|<p>A relationship between two species in which the individuals of one specie negatively affect those of the other and are unaffected themselves.</p><p></p><p>A negatively impacts B, while B does not impact A in any way.</p>|
