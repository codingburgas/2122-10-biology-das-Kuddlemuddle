**Carbohydrates**

Carbohydrates are biological molecules made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. This composition gives carbohydrates their name: they are made up of carbon (carbo-) plus water (-hydrate). They have the general formula Cn(H2O)m, where n>= 3. Carbohydrates belong to three categories: monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. 

**Monosaccharides**

Monosaccharides are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. Monosaccharides have a formula of (CH2O)n​, and they typically contain three to seven carbon atoms.

Sugars are also named according to their number of carbons: some of the most common types are trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and hexoses (six carbons).

**Oligosaccharides**

Oligosaccharides is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically 2 to 20) monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have a vital role in the immune response.

Oligosaccharides that consist of two monosaccharides are called disaccharides. They are soluble in water, have sweet taste and are mainly used to receive energy.

**Polysaccharides**

A long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide. The chain may be branched or unbranched and may contain several types of monosaccharides. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are some major examples of polysaccharides important in living organisms.
