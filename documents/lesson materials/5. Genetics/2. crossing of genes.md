  <h3>Crossing of genes</h3>

**The law of segregation**

- There are two types of alleles - dominant and recessive. A dominant allele hides a recessive allele and determines the organism's appearance.

- When an organism makes gametes, each gamete receives just one gene copy, which is selected randomly. This is known as the law of segregation.

- A Punnett square can be used to predict genotypes (allele combinations) and phenotypes (observable traits) of offspring from genetic crosses.

**The test cross**

- A test cross can be used to determine whether an organism with a dominant phenotype is homozygous or heterozygous.

Mendel came up with a way to figure out whether an organism with a dominant phenotype (such as a yellow-seeded pea plant) was a heterozygote (Yy) or a homozygote (YY). This technique is called a test cross. In a test cross, the organism with the dominant phenotype is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive (e.g., green-seeded).

**The law of independent assortment. Dihybrid cross**

Mendel's law of independent assortment states that the alleles of two (or more) different genes get sorted into gametes independently of one another. In other words, the allele a gamete receives for one gene does not influence the allele received for another gene.

A cross between two dihybrids is known as a dihybrid cross. When Mendel did this cross and looked at the offspring, he found that there were four different categories of pea seeds: yellow and round, yellow and wrinkled, green and round, and green and wrinkled. These phenotypic categories (categories defined by observable traits) appeared in a ratio of approximately 9:3:3:1.
