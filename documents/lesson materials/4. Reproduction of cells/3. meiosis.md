**What is meiosis?**

Meiosis is used to produce gametes—sex cells, or sperm and eggs. Its goal is to make daughter cells with exactly half as many chromosomes as the starting cell. To put that another way, meiosis in humans is a division process that takes us from a diploid cell—one with two sets of chromosomes—to haploid cells—ones with a single set of chromosomes. In humans, the haploid cells made in meiosis are sperm and eggs. When a sperm and an egg join in fertilization, the two haploid sets of chromosomes form a complete diploid set: a new genome.

**Phases of meiosis**

Meiosis is a lot like mitosis. The cell goes through similar stages and uses similar strategies to organize and separate chromosomes. In meiosis the cell must separate sister chromatids (the two halves of a duplicated chromosome), but it must also separate homologous chromosomes, the similar but nonidentical chromosome pairs an organism receives from its two parents.

These goals are accomplished in meiosis using a two-step division process. Homologue pairs separate during a first round of cell division, called meiosis I. Sister chromatids separate during a second round, called meiosis II. Since cell division occurs twice during meiosis, one starting cell can produce four gametes (eggs or sperm). In each round of division, cells go through four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 

**Meiosis I**

Before entering meiosis I, a cell must first go through interphase. As in mitosis, the cell grows during G1 phase, copies all of its chromosomes during S phase, and prepares for division during G2 phase.

During prophase I, differences from mitosis begin to appear. As in mitosis, the chromosomes begin to condense, but in meiosis I, they also pair up. Each chromosome carefully aligns with its homologue partner so that the two match up at corresponding positions along their full length.

In the image below, the letters A, B, and C represent genes found at particular spots on the chromosome, with capital and lowercase letters for different forms, or alleles, of each gene. The DNA is broken at the same spot on each homologue and reconnected in a crisscross pattern so that the homologues exchange part of their DNA.

This process, in which homologous chromosomes trade parts, is called crossing over. It's helped along by a protein structure called the synaptonemal complex that holds the homologues together. The chromosomes are positioned one on top of the other.

**Meiosis II**

The cells that enter meiosis II are the ones made in meiosis I. These cells are haploid—have just one chromosome from each homologue pair—but their chromosomes still consist of two sister chromatids. In meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, making haploid cells with non-duplicated chromosomes.
