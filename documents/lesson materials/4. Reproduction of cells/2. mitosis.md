**What is mitosis?**

Mitosis is a type of cell division in which one cell (the mother) divides to produce two new cells (the daughters) that are genetically identical to itself. Mitosis consists of four basic phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The phase when the body of the cell splits into two new cells is called cytokinesis.

**1. Prophase**

-	chromosomes start to condense
-	the mitotic spindle starts to form. Its job is to organise the chromosomes and move them around during mitosis.
-	the nucleolus disappears
-	the mitotic spindle begins to organise chromosomes

**2. Metaphase**

-	all the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (at the middle of the cell)
-	the cell checks weather all the chromosomes are correctly attached at the kinetochores to the microtubules. This is also called the spindle checkpoint and helps ensure that the sister chromatids will split evenly between the two daughter cells when they separate in the next step.

**3. Anaphase**

-	the sister chromatids separate from each other and are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell
-	the chromosomes of each pair are pulled towards opposite ends of the cell
-	microtubules not attached to chromosomes elongate and push apart, separating the poles and making the cell longer

**4. Telophase**

-	the cell is nearly done dividing, and it starts to re-establish its normal structures as cytokinesis (division of the cell contents) takes place
-	the mitotic spindle is broken down into its building blocks
-	two new nuclei form, one for each set of chromosomes. Nuclear membranes and nucleoli reappear.
-	chromosomes begin to decondense

**5. Cytokinesis**

-	the division of the cytoplasm to form two new cells, overlaps with the final stages of mitosis. It may start in either anaphase or telophase, depending on the cell, and finishes shortly after telophase.
