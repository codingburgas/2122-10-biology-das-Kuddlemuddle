## Information and development of a plan
### Presentation of the project
Our goal for the project was to create an application that both students and teachers would benefit from. The main idea is that our program can be used as a learning application for any subject, but given that our topic is biology, we have mainly focused on that aspect.

### Introduction
#### What is the product?
The product is a C++ console application for helping students and teachers with schoolwork, in particular with biology.
#### Where is it available?
Our collaborative work took place in GitHub. The files were uploaded in the GitHub Repository of our project so they can be accessible for everyone. You can download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/SSIvanov19/lathraea-rhodopaea/releases/download/v1.0.0/Release.zip) or the [download section](DOWNLOAD.md).
#### Communication?
Communication is realised through Teams and Discord. Thanks to all the features and the provided visualization - on-screen communication and feedback are sufficiently complete.
#### What technologies are used?
The technologies we used are C++ as the programming language with which the code is written, Git and GitHub for collaborative work, Visual Studio 2019 - as an IDE, Teams and Discord - connection and communication, PowerPoint and Word - for presentation and word documentation and Doxygen - for doxygen documentation.

### Method and manner of implementation
#### Productive work
The given tasks are presented in a way where everyone is informed of their current and previous duties. This method allows people to do their tasks more quickly, efficiently, and accurately, thus making the teamwork far more productive.
#### Distribution of tasks
For each task, the most skilled and well-informed person in the field is chosen. This allows for better end-results and the task is completed in the most competent way possible.
#### Terms
The Scrum Trainer observed the dates of the tasks and reminded the team to complete them on time. A meeting of the team is held every few days to discuss the amount of time needed for completion of a certain task and to discuss the progress which has been made.

## Testing the plan
### Organise the folder structure
This was the start of our project. The first thing that we should do is to organise the folder structure.
### Back-end account system
The account system is a good start for our project, as it is a core part of our project.
### Encryption system
Every good account system should have an encryption system. This is where we implemented the gray code.
### Create lesson materials
For presenting purposes, we created some premade lessons for the application having the project's topic biology in mind.
### Create questions for quizzes
For presenting purposes, we created some premade quizzes for the application having the project's topic biology in mind.
### Front-end create pages
The front-end pages will help the user out when using the program and give them a most satisfactory  experience of it.
### Front-end data visualization
The front-end data visualization is used to present the data in a more convenient way.
### Fix bugs
Fix the remaining bugs. 
### QA Documentation
Checking the correctness of the code.
### Documentation
Periodically made documentation describes the whole work and each application of the website.
### Presentation
The aim of the presentation is to be short and tell everything important about the project.

## Back-end developer
The back-end developer is responsible for the core functionality of the project. The main tasks of the back-end developer are:
### Account system
Account system, where the user can create an account, log in, log out, and visualise the events. It also has an admin account, where the admin can create, edit, delete and manager the events.
### Event system
Event system, where the admin can create, edit, delete and manage the events. 
### Storyline system
Storyline system, where the admin can create, edit, delete and manage the storylines.


## Front-end developer
The task of our front-end developer was to make the app look appealing and clean so the clients get the best experience possible from our application. For this purpose, creative ASCII art was used.
