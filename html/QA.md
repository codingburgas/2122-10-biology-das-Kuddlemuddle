# QA Documentation
# Introduction
The job of the QA engineer is very important, as he has to check if the code is correct. It’s not an easy job, as you always have to think of new ways to “break” the program so most of the problems in the code are corrected.

# Entry and exit criteria
## Entry Criteria
When the QA engineer starts his work, the program isn’t optimized and “cleared” from any problems it may have.

## Exit Criteria
When the QA engineer finished his work, the program is more optimized and up-to-date with less problems.

# Objectives and tasks
## Objective
The goal is that we end up with a complete and working product.

## Tasks
The tasks a QA engineer has to face are:
1.	Preparation of a QA documentation
2.	Testing the app
3.	Reports any problems
4.	Making a documentation about the corresponding problem

# Scope
The program has to be fully tested so any problems can be reported and solved.

# Test deliverables
The result of a tested program are that there will be fewer malfunctions and it will be more accessible for use.

# Test Cases
